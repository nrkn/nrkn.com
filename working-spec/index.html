            Working Spec creates interactive animated 3D models of your product
            assembly or application instructions and puts them onto users’ mobile
            devices — making it faster and easier for your products to be
            assembled or applied correctly.

        <h1>Save Time and Money</h1>
        <p>
          Working Spec can quickly create cost-effective 3D models from your
          existing 2D assembly and application instructions, saving you the
          expense of making in-house videos.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h1>Existing Platform</h1>
        <p>
          No need to develop or maintain your own app at great expense. All you
          need is to add your content to an existing platform which is constantly
          being updated and improved on.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Easy to Understand</h1>
        <p>
          Interactive animated 3D models are much easier to understand than 2D
          drawings, and much less time consuming than watching videos showing
          assembly in action. Viewers with English as a second language can also
          understand 3D animations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Easy to Use</h1>
        <p>
          QR codes on brochures, product packaging and building plans make it easy
          for a person to access 3D models on their mobile phones. No technical
          skills or special software is required to download 3D models.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Improve Building Quality</h1>
        <p>
          Communicating assembly and application instructions clearly through
          interactive animated 3D models will reduce construction mistakes,
          resulting in a better quality build. And when your building components
          are correctly assembled, they’ll function properly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Speed up Construction</h1>
        <p>
          Interactive animated 3D models mean builders will spend less time
          puzzling over complex 2D drawings, speeding up the overall build
          process.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Assist your Sales Team</h1>
        <p>
          Working Spec 3D animations provide an engaging way for Product and sales
          representatives to explain complex assembly or application instructions.
          When specifiers and builders understand your product, they’re more
          likely to recommend it for a project.
